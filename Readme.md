****✈️ Airline Customer Loyalty & Flight Analytics****
This project analyzes customer loyalty and flight activity data for a fictional airline program. It uses Python to extract trends, identify key behaviors, and visualize patterns that can support business decisions in customer retention and segmentation.

**📁 Dataset Overview**
The project uses two primary datasets:

***Customer Loyalty History***

Details on customer demographics, loyalty card tier (Star, Nova, Aura), education, salary, enrollment and cancellation dates, and CLV.

***Customer Flight Activity***

Monthly-level records of flights taken by each customer, including distance flown, points accumulated/redeemed, and flight volume.

**📊 Project Goals**

--Analyze enrollment patterns and loyalty card trends

--Aggregate flight activity metrics by time and customer

--Prepare a clean visual layer to support insights

--Separate core analytics from business-facing interpretations
